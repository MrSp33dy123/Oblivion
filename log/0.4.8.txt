The '>' character is what you use to get my attention in _most_ cases. Type it in to get a shortlist of commands.
Many of my functions will take variables that will be parsed in it's execution, and they are formatted like `>command(var1|var2|var3)`. To find out what inputs a function requires, simply type `>help(command)`.
Currently the `>suggest()` command is disfunctional, so if you wish to make suggestions or submit bug reports, go to https://github.com/MrSp33dy123/Oblivion/issues
