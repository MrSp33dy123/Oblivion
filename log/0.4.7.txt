AuDraco @ general-banter >> Why is Adolf Hitler considered "The Most Evil" Man in History?
He saved Germany and Western Europe from communism, he made Germany become a super power within 3 years, he created over 3 million jobs, he put Germans back on their feet, and he created his own money. HOW IS THAT CONSIDERED EVIL ?????

The Great Sage Noogai @ general-banter >> <@!175670558040653825> Better watch your mouth or you'll be banned for heresy
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> Lol
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> Nikolai goes through a weekly cycle. Like around once a week you buy some hyped game, and then in the next day or two you refund it <@175670558040653825>
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> <@175670558040653825> while he did create a lot of jobs, bringing unemployment down from like 9 million to 1 million, if memory serves correctly, they weren't really jobs
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> Because he made it so that a _lot_ of people couldn't legally work, which meant that they didn't count as unemployed- that's women, jews, all that
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> He also had a shit ton of people join the army, which also made them not technically unemployed
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> So although the numbers can be made to seem as if he massively helped unemployment, while he did help with unemployment a bit, he didn't help nearly as much as it initially seemed
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> Also, he kinda cheated his way into power. From around 1924 onwards, Germany was actually starting to do pretty well compared to after the end of WW1. They had some economic reform, American loans, easier to meet reparations payments than pre-1924. The German economy was looking up, and a lot of it was thanks to this guy called Stresemann. He was the foreign relations minister or something like that and served as chancellor for like a year, before dying in 1928
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> Germany was having a bit of a tougher time there as all the different political factions basically went for it. After Stresemann's death the extremes were starting to look a lot better than previously. Hitler basically seized the opportunity of an open field with people who were pretty concerned about what was going on to say really extreme shit along the lines of, "make Germany great again." But he wouldn't have gotten into power if it wasn't for being a complete ass
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> We're talking like people from other parties showing up dead and all that from mysterious causes. It got to a point where all of the Communist party had left the country, and most of the socialists, I believe, had pissed off as well. Basically, there was no opposition in the Parliament and Hitler could do whatever he wanted.
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> Germany only got to become a superpower again because the ither countries really wanted peace and didn't want to believe that a second world war would happen after the atrocities they witnessed in ww1. And anyway, prior to WW1, Germany was already looking like the most powerful country in mainland Europe. So it's not as if Germany started at the bottom, Hitler just took back the stuff that Germany had taken from them in the Treaty of Versailles and stopped paying reparations. And everyone else was weak af too
AuDraco @ gaming-banter >> <@119265563359969280> Nah, its just started
AuDraco @ gaming-banter >> Its really fun. Its like a demo, but for all the games on steam
AuDraco @ gaming-banter >> Ever space wasn't hyped tho
AuDraco @ general-banter >> Yo, I'm not reading that
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> You could perhaps argue that he saved them from communism, but that can't really be said for sure, as while the communists did have support, there were still other parties that had much more support. Germany might have gone into communism, but that is speculation really as we don't know what could have happened next
AuDraco @ general-banter >> I was just copying a Yahoo Answers question
AuDraco @ general-banter >> Just a prank. Ro
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> The thing that really made Hitler get into power was  his speaking ability. Most people in Germany thought that his ideas were a bit radical
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> Oh screw you
Jimmeh @ general-banter >> Stresemann and the Dawes Plan/Young Plan put Germany back on its feet. They were doing well
The Great Sage Noogai @ general-banter >> <@!175670558040653825> That is actually incredibly rude. James spends all that time writing something that is educational, purely for the benefit of your understanding of the world, and you go "LOL, TL;DR". You're discraceful.

Piccadi11y @ gaming-banter >> kinda
Piccadi11y @ gaming-banter >> it has Display Port as opposed to HDMI, which means you'll only be able to use it with your computer
Piccadi11y @ gaming-banter >> http://pricespy.co.nz/product.php?j=1963894,3393127

Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> As in, if you play a game your ping consistently spikes to 1000-2000 and you are trapped in spawn, unable to move, sometimes teleporting forwards and then back again, and then you're balfway across the map, and then you're back at spawn, and occasionally hear snatches of your teammates' conversations?
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> It isn't our internet itself. I should have been more accurate and said our modem
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> The only way online games are playable for me rn is if no one is streaming anything
The Great Sage Noogai @ gaming-banter >> <@!119265563359969280> I have two sentences for you;

Get a new computer;

Get a new modem.
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> Which is basically never as both my brother and sister plop down after school and sit there watching their shows for hours straight
The Great Sage Noogai @ gaming-banter >> All your problems can be solved with that
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> The only problem with that
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> Is that my parents are not sympathetix towards video games
AuDraco @ gaming-banter >> <@119265563359969280> Get a job
AuDraco @ gaming-banter >> If you can
AuDraco @ gaming-banter >> And then you'll be able to buy a headset and a modem
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> I have enough money and am working this summer <@175670558040653825>
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> It doesn't make a difference
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> If my parents don't support me buying gaming stuff, I will not buy it

The Great Sage Noogai @ gaming-banter >> <@!119265563359969280> I guess I'm lucky in that both of the career fields I'm looking at going into (film making, programming) require good computers, so I always have that excuse
Jimmeh @ gaming-banter >> Yeah haha
The Great Sage Noogai @ gaming-banter >> Funnily enough, they also require good headsets
The Great Sage Noogai @ gaming-banter >> And mice
The Great Sage Noogai @ gaming-banter >> and keyboards
The Great Sage Noogai @ gaming-banter >> But most of all, cameras
